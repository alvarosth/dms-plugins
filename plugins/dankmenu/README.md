# dankMenu

One key to every command on the machine — a hierarchical, searchable root menu
for [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell), in
the shape of [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy)'s `Super+Space`
menu.

Type instead of navigating, and it searches every command below the level
you're on — with a breadcrumb telling you where each result lives:

## Credits

The design is [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy)'s, by
[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) and its contributors (MIT). Omarchy binds
`SUPER+SPACE` to `omarchy-menu`, a hierarchical menu covering apps, settings,
toggles and power actions — the single entry point to the whole desktop.

This plugin reimplements that idea for DMS. It shares no code with Omarchy, but
it deliberately keeps **their menu file schema field-for-field**, so subtrees of
[`omarchy-menu.jsonc`](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/blob/master/default/omarchy/omarchy-menu.jsonc)
paste in and parse unchanged, and their `when` / `checked` / `disabled`
semantics behave the same way. The IPC verbs mirror `omarchy-menu`'s too, so
routes and muscle memory carry over.

The schema is a superset, not a copy: [`labelCmd`](#live-labels) and the
[array form](#the-file-format) are additions of ours. Omarchy menus still paste
in unchanged — neither appears in them — but a menu using either will not work
in Omarchy.

Go try the real thing if you're on Arch — it's very good.

## Why a window instead of a spotlight plugin

DMS already supports `type: launcher` plugins that add rows to its spotlight, so
that looks like the obvious way to build this. It cannot work: DMS's launcher
controller emits `itemExecuted` after every selection and the spotlight modal
hides itself on that signal unconditionally, with no hook for a plugin to
prevent it. "Enter descends into a submenu" is therefore impossible there —
selecting a row always closes the launcher.

So dankMenu is a `daemon` plugin owning its own wlr-layershell window, and its
search, ranking and app list are its own code. Two things are borrowed from the
shell rather than rebuilt: `SessionService.launchDesktopEntry`, so apps started
from the menu land in the right systemd scope instead of being reparented to the
shell process, and the launcher plugins themselves — see below.

## Install

Requires DMS ≥ 1.5.0. Nothing else — the plugin is QML and JavaScript, there is
no build step, and it references no path above its own root.

**Any distro**, from the [DMS plugin registry](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugin-registry):

```bash
dms plugins install dankMenu
```

Then enable it in DMS: `Mod+,` → Plugins → enable **Dank Menu**. `dms plugins list`
confirms the shell has picked it up, and `dms plugins update dankMenu` pulls a
newer version later.

<details>
<summary><b>From a clone instead</b> — for hacking on it, or pinning it to the repo</summary>

The directory name must match `plugin.json`'s `id`, `dankMenu`. Symlinking the
clone means the plugin updates with a `git pull`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sitolam/dms-plugins ~/src/dms-plugins
mkdir -p ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins
ln -s ~/src/dms-plugins/plugins/dankmenu ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/dankMenu
```

Or copy the directory, if you don't want the clone lying around:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sitolam/dms-plugins /tmp/dms-plugins
cp -r /tmp/dms-plugins/plugins/dankmenu ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/dankMenu
```

</details>

**On NixOS, via home-manager.** `dms plugins install` writes into `~/.config`,
which a declarative setup usually doesn't want, so take the plugin as a flake
package instead:

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell.plugins.dankMenu = {
  enable = true;
  src = inputs.dms-plugins.packages.${pkgs.system}.dankmenu;
};
```

Note that with `managePluginSettings = true`, `plugin_settings.json` becomes a
read-only store symlink — the plugin must be enabled declaratively as above,
because the DMS settings GUI cannot write to it.

Finally, bind it. For niri:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Space { spawn "dms" "ipc" "call" "dankMenu" "toggle" "root"; }
}
```

For Hyprland:

```conf
bind = SUPER, SPACE, exec, dms ipc call dankMenu toggle root
```

For Sway:

```
bindsym $mod+space exec dms ipc call dankMenu toggle root
```

For anything else — river, Wayfire, a keybind daemon, a script: bind that same
shell command. It is an ordinary one-shot process with no compositor-specific
parts, so whatever can run a command can open the menu.

## Usage

```bash
dms ipc call dankMenu toggle          # open at the root, or close if open
dms ipc call dankMenu open system     # open straight into a submenu
dms ipc call dankMenu open power-menu # aliases work too
dms ipc call dankMenu close
dms ipc call dankMenu refresh         # re-read the menu file
```

Because `open` takes a route, any submenu can have its own keybind — a power
menu on `Mod+Escape` is just `dms ipc call dankMenu open system`.

| key | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | enter a submenu, or run a row and close |
| `Right` | enter a submenu, when the cursor is at the end of the query |
| `Escape` | up one level; at the root, close |
| `Left` / `Backspace` | up one level, when the query is empty |
| `Up` / `Down` | move the selection |
| any text | search this level's whole subtree |

### vim bindings

Every one is `Ctrl`-prefixed. Bare `hjkl` cannot navigate here: the search field
is always focused and always accepting a query, so plain letters have to reach
it as text.

| key | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+J` / `Ctrl+K` | down / up (`Ctrl+N` / `Ctrl+P` also work) |
| `Ctrl+L` / `Ctrl+H` | in / out — enter a submenu, or go up a level |
| `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` | half a page down / up |
| `Ctrl+G` | close the menu outright, from any depth |

Going back out of a submenu returns the highlight to the row you entered
through, not to the top of the list.

## Configuring the menu

The whole menu is one JSONC file. The plugin ships
[`menu.jsonc`](menu.jsonc) as a starting point; point the **`menuPath`** setting
at your own file to replace it entirely. Whichever file is live is watched, so
saving it updates the menu immediately — no shell restart, no `refresh` call.

Set `menuPath` in DMS under `Mod+,` → Plugins → Dank Menu, or declaratively:

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell.plugins.dankMenu.settings.menuPath = "/home/you/.config/dankmenu.jsonc";
```

### The file format

JSONC — JSON with `//` comments and trailing commas, the same dialect Omarchy
uses. Object keys are **dotted ids**, and the dots *are* the hierarchy:
`setup.network.dns` is a child of `setup.network`, which is a child of `setup`.
Declaration order is display order.

```jsonc
{
  // A submenu: no action, no target, no provider.
  "system": {"icon":"power_settings_new","label":"System","aliases":["power-menu"]},

  // An action: runs a shell command, then closes the menu.
  "system.lock": {"icon":"lock","label":"Lock","action":"loginctl lock-session"},

  // A link: opens in your browser.
  "learn.niri": {"icon":"grid_view","label":"Niri","target":"https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki"},

  // A provider: contents generated at open time. "apps" is the only one so far.
  "apps": {"icon":"apps","label":"Apps","provider":"apps"},
}
```

The file can also be an **array of rows**, each carrying its dotted id in an
`id` field. It is the same tree — the dots still make the hierarchy — and array
order is display order:

```jsonc
[
  {"id":"system","icon":"power_settings_new","label":"System","aliases":["power-menu"]},
  {"id":"system.lock","icon":"lock","label":"Lock","action":"loginctl lock-session"},
  {"id":"apps","icon":"apps","label":"Apps","provider":"apps"},
]
```

That form is for generated menus, whose tools often cannot choose the order of
an object's keys — see [Generating the tree](#generating-the-tree). A row
without a string `id` stops the whole file loading, as a syntax error does.

The **kind of a row is inferred**, never declared: `action` makes it an action,
`target` a link, `provider` a provider-backed submenu, and anything else a plain
submenu.

### Fields

| field | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | the row's dotted id, in the array form only. In the object form the key is the id. |
| `label` | the row's text. Defaults to its id. |
| `icon` | a [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) name (`wifi`, `school`). App rows use the icon theme instead. |
| `iconFont` | font family for the glyph, when it isn't the menu font |
| `title` | header text when the submenu is open. Defaults to `label`. |
| `aliases` | extra names for `open <route>`, and extra search terms |
| `action` | shell command, run through `bash -lc` |
| `target` | URL, opened externally |
| `provider` | generated contents — currently only `apps` |
| `when` | hide the row unless this succeeds |
| `checked` | append a ✓ when this succeeds |
| `disabled` | dim the row and block selection when this succeeds |
| `labelCmd` | replace the row's label with this snippet's output |

Actions go through `bash -lc`, so pipes, `$(…)`, `&&` and quoting all work —
menu actions are shell text, not argv.

### Conditions

`when`, `checked` and `disabled` are shell snippets, judged by **exit status**.
They make the menu reflect the machine rather than just describe it:

```jsonc
// Ticked while night mode is actually on.
"trigger.toggle.night": {
  "icon":"nightlight","label":"Night Mode",
  "checked":"dms ipc call night status | grep -q enabled",
  "action":"dms ipc call night toggle"
},

// Absent entirely on a desktop.
"trigger.toggle.battery": {
  "icon":"battery_std","label":"Battery Percentage",
  "when":"test -d /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0",
  "action":"dms ipc call bar toggle"
},
```

![conditions in action](screenshots/conditions.png)

Every snippet for one menu level runs in a **single** shell, not one process per
row, so a level with a dozen conditions costs one spawn. Rows stay visible while
results are pending, so a slow condition delays a tick rather than making rows
flicker in and out of the list.

### Live labels

`labelCmd` is the odd one out: it is judged by its **output**, not its exit
status. Its first line of stdout becomes the row's label, which is the only way
to put a live value in front of someone — the menu tree is a static file, so
`label` alone can never show a number that changes.

```jsonc
// Reads "Memory  2.1GiB / 4GiB" rather than "Memory".
"windows.memory": {
  "icon":"memory",
  "label":"Memory",
  "labelCmd":"docker stats --no-stream --format '{{.MemUsage}}' windows | sed 's/^/Memory  /'",
  "disabled":"true"
},
```

Details worth knowing:

- Output is clamped to **one line** and stripped of tabs, because it travels as
  one field of a tab-separated record.
- **stderr is discarded.** A warning from the snippet would otherwise be
  rendered as the label.
- Empty output falls back to the static `label`, so a snippet that fails leaves
  a sensible row rather than a blank one. Give every `labelCmd` row a `label`
  worth falling back to.
- It is a **snapshot**, taken when the level opens — like the other three
  conditions. It is not a running meter; reopen the level to refresh.
- Keep it fast. Every snippet for a level runs in one shell, and the level waits
  on all of them.

Conditions are re-evaluated every time you enter a level, so a tick is never
stale. While a search is active they cover the whole subtree being searched.

### Apps

The `apps` provider lists your desktop entries, ranked by the plugin's own
fuzzy scorer plus a frecency boost. At the **root**, a search covers apps too —
so one keystroke sequence finds either a command or a program.

![the apps provider](screenshots/apps.png)

### Launcher plugins

Your `type: launcher` plugins — calculator, emoji, whatever else you have
installed — work here too, under the same triggers they use in spotlight:

```
=12*30      calculator
;shrug      emoji
```

![a calculator answer in the menu](screenshots/plugins.png)

The trigger is honoured at **any level**, not just the root: the prefix is
explicit intent, and the level you are standing in has nothing to say about an
arithmetic expression. A plugin's rows come back in the plugin's own order,
unranked — this menu's scorer would throw away a calculator result whose label
(`360`) shares no letters with the query that produced it.

A plugin set to *always active* in DMS (its trigger cleared) needs no prefix. It
answers every **root** search, and its rows sit above the apps and commands.

Nothing here is configured in dankMenu: the list of plugins, their triggers and
their settings are DMS's, under `Mod+,` → Plugins, and a change there takes
effect in the menu immediately. Selecting a plugin row runs it through DMS,
which is what puts a calculator result on the clipboard.

Plugins are asked for rows only while the menu is open and only for the query as
typed, so an unused plugin costs nothing.

### Generating the tree

Because `menuPath` is just a path, the file can be generated. On NixOS that
means menu rows can reference store paths and your own flake.

Write the rows as a list in the [array form](#the-file-format) and hand it to
`builtins.toJSON`. Nix serialises an attrset's names alphabetically, so rows
keyed by id would come out sorted — and a power menu reading "lock, logout,
reboot, shutdown, suspend" is not the one anybody wants — but a list keeps its
order:

```nix
let
  rows = [
    { id = "update"; icon = "system_update"; label = "Update"; }
    { id = "update.rebuild"; icon = "build"; label = "Rebuild";
      action = "ghostty --working-directory=${flakeDir} -e just rebuild"; }
    { id = "update.firmware"; icon = "memory"; label = "Firmware";
      action = "fwupdmgr update"; }
  ];
in
{
  programs.dank-material-shell.plugins.dankMenu.settings.menuPath =
    "${pkgs.writeText "dankmenu.json" (builtins.toJSON rows)}";
}
```

Any other generator that sorts or loses key order — Go's `encoding/json`,
`jq -S` — can use the array form the same way. See
[sitolamix's `plugins.nix`](https://github.com/sitolam/sitolamix/blob/main/modules/desktop/dms/plugins.nix)
for a full worked example.

## Development

```bash
nix develop ../..
qmltestrunner -input tests/tst_menumodel.qml
qmltestrunner -input tests/tst_search.qml
qmltestrunner -input tests/tst_conditions.qml
qmltestrunner -input tests/tst_plugins.qml
```

`qmltestrunner` takes one `-input` per run and exits with the failure count.
`nix flake check` runs all four headless.

`MenuModel.js` (JSONC parsing, tree building, route resolution), `Search.js`
(scoring and ranking), `Conditions.js` (script generation and output parsing)
and `Plugins.js` (trigger detection, plugin items to menu rows) import no QML
types at all, so the tests exercise the exact files the plugin loads rather than
copies of them. The QML files are thin shells over those four.

| file | responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `DankMenuDaemon.qml` | IPC handler, menu file loading, window lifecycle |
| `MenuWindow.qml` | the layershell window, keys, row building |
| `MenuList.qml` | list and row delegate |
| `Conditions.qml` | runs the generated condition script |
| `AppSource.qml` | desktop entries in, menu rows out |
| `PluginSource.qml` | DMS launcher plugins in, menu rows out |
